 the bug that  was introduced?
It outputs the lines which are different or replaced in the two files
By seeing them we can notice the bugs.

How could having a easy access to the entire history of a file make you
 a more efficient programmer in the long term?
We need not do repeatitive work.We can simply copy and paste required 
code.we can also go back and forth for required changes without making 
permanent changes to it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,like you do in Git,vs having versions automatically saved,like Google docs does?
pros
correct required no. of commits
cons
difficult to do it mauanlly,human error .

Why do you think some version control systems,like Git,allow saving multiple files in pne commit,while others,like3 Google Docs,treat each file separately?
easy to handle changes in interlinked files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log can be used to view all the commits and git diff  can be used to find the differences between files of two different versions.
