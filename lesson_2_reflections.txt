What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

HEAD means the current checked out branch (think as a pointer to it).


jokes
git diff commit 1 commit 2
git add
git reset HEAD
git commit
git status

git diff(with no arguments shows diff between working directory and staging area)
git diff --staged(with no arguments shows diff between staging area and recent most commit)
git diff commit 1 commit 2

git branch
(with no arguments shows the existing branches)

git branch
(with a argument creates a new branch)

git log --graph --oneline master coins 

git show commitID shows the diff between the commit and its parent(not intutive in presence of brances).
git branch -d branch_name  deletes that branch (once test run and understand this)

git merge 
if conflicts resolve also remove those special lines then save
then git status
git add
git commit
done
